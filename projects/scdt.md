# Supply Chain Decision Translator

## Problem
Leadership reviews supply chain data frequently,
but decisions stall due to unclear prioritization and ownership.

Dashboards show metrics, not actions.

## Approach
The Supply Chain Decision Translator converts weekly signals into:
- Prioritized risks
- Clear ownership
- Recommended actions

The focus is on decision readiness, not reporting volume.

## What It Delivers
- Highlights what truly needs attention
- Clarifies who owns each issue
- Enables faster leadership alignment

## Why This Matters
This project shows how analytics should enable decisions,
not just visibility.
