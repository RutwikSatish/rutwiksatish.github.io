# FactoryPulse - Production Flow Simulator

<img src="../assets/factorypulse.png" alt="FactoryPulse Screenshot">

## Problem
Production delays often persist despite adding capacity.
The root cause is usually unmanaged variability and excess WIP,
not insufficient resources.

## Approach
FactoryPulse is a simulation-based learning tool designed to study:
- Bottlenecks
- Work in process
- Throughput
- Cycle time

The system compares PUSH and CONWIP production control strategies.

## Key Insights
- Excess WIP increases cycle time without improving throughput
- Flow control stabilizes execution more effectively than capacity expansion
- Variability is a primary driver of delay

## Why This Matters
This project demonstrates systems thinking around
flow, variability, and production control.
