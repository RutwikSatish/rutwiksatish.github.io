## Problem
Planners monitor hundreds of SKUs, but operational risk is uneven.
Attention is spread too thin, leading to reactive firefighting,
excess inventory, and missed service risks.

## Decision Logic
PlanPulse prioritizes SKUs using:
- Demand volatility
- Inventory exposure
- Service level sensitivity

These signals are combined into a single risk-based prioritization score.

## What the System Delivers
- Ranks SKUs by true operational risk
- Quantifies service versus inventory versus cash trade-offs
- Recommends next-best planning actions
- Reduces manual weekly analysis effort

## Why This Matters
This project demonstrates how planning teams can move from
reactive monitoring to proactive, risk-based decision making.
