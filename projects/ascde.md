# Adaptive Supply Chain Decision Engine

## Problem
Forecast error, inventory imbalance, and service risk
are often reviewed in isolation, making prioritization unclear.

## Approach
ASCDE integrates multiple planning signals into a
single decision framework:
- Forecast risk from historical demand behavior
- Demand variability
- Inventory exposure

## What It Delivers
- SKU-level risk prioritization
- Clear trade-offs between service and inventory
- Planning visibility through interactive dashboards

## Why This Matters
This project demonstrates how fragmented analytics
can be unified into clear execution priorities.
