## About

I am a graduate student in Engineering Management at Northeastern University with one year of hands-on internship experience across logistics and industrial engineering.

Through internships and independent projects, I focus on solving real-world supply chain problems such as inventory imbalance, planning noise, and execution delays. I build decision-support systems that translate operational data into clear, actionable insights for planners and operations teams.
