## About

I am a graduate student in Engineering Management at Northeastern University with one year of hands-on internship experience across logistics and industrial engineering.

Beyond my internships, I research real-world supply chain problems such as inventory imbalance, planning noise, and execution delays. I build decision-support systems that translate operational data into clear, actionable decisions.

## Flagship Project

<div class="card">
<strong>PlanPulse - Demand Planning Auto Analyst</strong>

<p><strong>Problem</strong><br>
Planners monitor hundreds of SKUs, but risk is uneven. This leads to reactive firefighting and excess inventory.</p>

<p><strong>Solution</strong><br>
A decision-support system that prioritizes SKUs based on demand volatility, inventory exposure, and service risk.</p>

<p><strong>What it delivers</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Ranks SKUs by true operational risk</li>
<li>Quantifies service versus inventory versus cash trade-offs</li>
<li>Recommends next-best planning actions</li>
</ul>
