# Hi, I’m Rutwik 👋

### Supply Chain & Operations Analyst  
### Inventory, Planning & Flow Decision Systems

I’m a graduate student in Engineering Management at Northeastern University with **one year of hands-on internship experience** across logistics and industrial engineering.

Beyond my internships, I research **real-world supply chain failure modes**—inventory imbalance, planning noise, execution delays—and build **decision-support systems** that translate messy operational data into clear, actionable decisions.

I’m interested in roles where **data, operations, and judgment intersect**, especially in:
- Supply Chain Analytics  
- Inventory & Demand Planning  
- Operations & Execution Support

## Flagship Project  
# PlanPulse — Demand Planning Auto-Analyst

**Problem**  
Planners monitor hundreds of SKUs, but attention is often spread evenly—despite risk being highly uneven.  
This leads to reactive firefighting, excess inventory, and missed service risks.

**My Approach**  
I designed a decision-support system that prioritizes SKUs based on:
- Demand volatility  
- Inventory exposure  
- Service-level sensitivity  

Instead of “monitor everything,” the system answers:  
**_Where should planner attention go this week?_**

**What PlanPulse Does**
- Ranks SKUs by **true operational risk**
- Quantifies **service vs inventory vs cash trade-offs**
- Generates explainable next-best planning actions
- Automates weekly summaries to reduce manual analysis

**Why It Matters**  
PlanPulse demonstrates how planning teams can shift from reactive monitoring to **risk-based decision making**.
